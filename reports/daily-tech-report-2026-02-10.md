## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR FOUNDERS & OPERATORS

- **Capital Concentration Intensifying:** The top 5 AI companies (OpenAI, Scale AI, Anthropic, xAI, Project Prometheus) captured 20% of all venture funding in 2025 ($84B). For founders: differentiation is critical. AI "wrapper" companies are struggling; deep workflow integration is the survival path.

- **AI Layoffs Accelerating:** ~55,000 US tech layoffs in 2025 cited AI as a factor. Companies are replacing human workers with cheaper AI. Expect more cost-cutting through AI substitution this year. This creates talent supply and opens opportunities for AI-powered service businesses.

- **Physical AI Emerges:** Drone inventory (Gather AI $40M), robotics (Skild AI $1.4B), and AI engineering design (Neural Concept $100M) are seeing major funding. The next frontier isn't just software — it's AI controlling physical world operations.

- **Vertical AI Wins:** Harvey (legal), Synthpop (healthcare admin), Galux (biotech protein design) demonstrate that domain-specific AI with deep workflow integration outperforms generic models. Build depth, not breadth.
