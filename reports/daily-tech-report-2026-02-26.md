- **Regulatory tailwinds/tailwinds**: Pentagon-Anthropic conflict shows AI safety is becoming a competitive moat AND a regulatory liability. Companies need to navigate carefully.

- **Data privacy liability**: Amazon Wishlist doxxing issue highlights how small product changes can create massive PR/liability exposure.

- **Niche wins**: Reddit's r/Entrepreneur shows $22K/mo opportunities in hyper-niche verticals (pediatric dental marketing). Specificity > breadth.

- **Competitor intelligence**: "Stealing customers from 9-figure competitors" - big cos are deaf to complaints. Monitor Reddit/X for competitor grievances and pounce.
